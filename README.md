## Overview

### The challenge

Users would be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1>The HTML code I'm proud of is using the <b>role</b> and <b>aria-labelledby</b> for accessibility</h1>

<div class="form__control" role="group" aria-labelledby="day-label"></div>
```

```css
/*I am proud of this css below*/
  input::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
  input::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  margin: 0;
  }

  input[type='number'] {
    -moz-appearance: textfield;
  }
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('The function organization and the implementation of Single Responsibility principle is what I am proud. ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

- Breaking the code into modules
- Implement DRY principle
- Implemnt KISS principle

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools Online schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for accessiblity implementation.
